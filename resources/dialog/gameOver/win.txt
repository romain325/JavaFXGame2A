Things started to be weird those days,
The hotel man was really weird
During the night you decided to brave the danger
And you get out of your room
You jumped from the first floor and ran through the forest
Your mobile data was back after 1km and you call the police
After investigation, the hotel man was named Sir Alfred
He was hiding a Mobile Jammer and lots of knives/ropes
There was 7 person in town and {{dead}} died because of him ...
And you too because you didn't act fast enough.
As you want to erase those thoughts, we'll erase your save {{name}}
Goodbye {{name}}
Oh and avoid the 13th room next time !!
