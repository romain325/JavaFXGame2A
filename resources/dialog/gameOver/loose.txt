Hard to sleep tonight isn't it ? ...
Maybe because of this presence behind you ...
But you still look through the window
You ear a noise and suddenly see the hotel man,
he doesn't seem really normal
You want to ask him to let you sleep
but he pull out a knife and throw it at you
"Farewell {{name}}, you had 7 days"
"all of them are dead and so you'll be"
Is that it ? You died ? Is the narrator that lazy ?
Or maybe a bit tired ?
While you're thinking out of the box he continues:
"And nobody will remember you, I'll erase you."
*Erase player.obj*
Nothing is holding you anymore except this instance
He goes away of the room, nothing holds you anymore
The garbage collector is coming, you hear him ...
Farewell {{name}} ...
Nobody will remind you
