Welcome Sir, Hope you'll have a great stay in our hotel\nYou're in the room 13
Had a great day ?\nI hope so!\nGood night
You liked the breakfast this morning ?\nI made it myself \nWe don't have a lot of customer and no chef since the bridge broke
Enjoy your stay here with us\nHope you'll like today's meal
Welcome Sir, can you give me a review about my new Velvet costume ?\nIs it classy enough ?
Good night Sir\nHope you met kind people today
Goodbye sir, farewell
