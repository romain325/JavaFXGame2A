Welcome Sir, Hope you'll have a great stay in our hotel\nYou're in the room 13
Had a great night yesterday ??\nI hope so!\nGood night
You liked the breakfast yesterday morning ?\nI made it myself \nWe don't have a lot of customer and no chef since the bridge broke
The news aren't great this morning, sounds like rumours to me\nAnyway, enjoy your stay here with us\nHope you'll like today's meal
